#+TITLE: Org-Sanpo

*CURRENT STATE: EXPERIMENTAL*

Org-sanpo is a [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam]]-like system built on top of org-mode.
It is heavilly inspired by and based off of [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam][org-roam]].

There are three main differences:

 1. Headline as Note
 2. Link by ID
 3. Utilize Git for Cache
