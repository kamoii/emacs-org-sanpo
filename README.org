#+TITLE: Org-Sanpo

*CURRENT STATE: EXPERIMENTAL*

Org-sanpo is a [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam]]-like system built on top of org-mode.
It is heavilly inspired by and based off of [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam][org-roam]].

There are three main differences:

 1. Headline as Note
 2. Link by ID
 3. Utilize Git for Cache

* Configuration

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org-sanpo)
;; Root directory for your org files. It also must be a git repository root.
(setq org-sanpo-directory "~/org/")
;; The first time called cache will be created from scratch. It may take some time.
(org-sanpo-mode)
;; Define some bindings.
(define-key org-sanpo-mode-map (kbd "C-c n f") 'org-sanpo-find-file)
(define-key org-mode-map       (kbd "C-c n i") 'org-sanpo-insert-link)
#+end_src
